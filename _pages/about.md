🧑🏽‍💻 I'm a Master's student at Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg ([OvGU](https://www.ovgu.de/))  studying Chemical and Energy Engineering on a scholarship from International Max Planck Research School for Advances in Process and Systems Engineering ([IMPRS ProEng](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/imprs)) at Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems ([MPI DCTS](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/2316/en)).

🔍 My interests lie in Process Systems Engineering applied to chemicals and pharmaceuticals production and manufacturing systems.

💻 I'm also a research assistant with [Prof. Dr.-Ing. René Schenkendorf](https://www.hs-harz.de/rschenkendorf/zur-person) at Department of Automation and Computer Science, Hochschule Harz where I'm working on adaptation and evaluation of a Model-Based Design of Experiment (MBDoE) concept for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

📈 I'm also an incoming intern (Jan'24) in the Digital Services team at [Covestro](https://www.covestro.com/en/company/covestro-worldwide/deutschland/covestro-in-deutschland/standorte/leverkusen), Germany.
